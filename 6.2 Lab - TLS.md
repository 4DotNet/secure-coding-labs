## 1. Create a pfx file

For ASP.NET it's easiest to create a PKCS#12 file from the key and the certificate chain. To build the chain, we need to include both the intermediate and the root ca cert in the file. Make sure you set a password for the output file.
```powershell
step certificate p12 api1.pfx api1.crt api1.key `
  --ca ~/.step/certs/intermediate_ca.crt `
  --ca ~/.step/certs/root_ca.crt
```

### 2. Create a server

Create a new dotnet web api:
```
dotnet new webapi --name server
```

Edit the `appsettings.development.json` file to add the following section to instruct the built-in web server, Kestrel, to use our certificate
```json
"Kestrel": {
  "Certificates": {
    "Default": {
       "Path": "../api1.pfx"
     }
   }
}
```
Since we've set a password on the certificate file, we need to specify that as well.
We're obviously NOT going to store the certificate password in source code. Instead we'll use [user secrets](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets)

Change into the folder where the server project is: `cd server`

First, initialize user secrets for the project:
```powershell
dotnet user-secrets init
```
Then store the password for the certificate:
```powershell
dotnet user-secrets set Kestrel:Certificates:Default:Password TopSecret
```
Make sure you replace `TopSecret` with the password for your .pfx file.

You should now be able to run the project:
```powershell
dotnet run --launch-profile https
```

The output shows you what port is used for HTTPS, open a browser and navigate to https://api1.localhost:PORT/weatherforecast

`PORT` is different for each project you create, so you'll have to look at the console output to find the https port.

Your browser will show a warning. You should be able to bypass this using the `advanced` button.  

üîçÔ∏è Inspect the certificate by clicking on the lock icon.

Alternatively, you can use `curl` to view the certificate:

``` powershell
curl -v https://api1.localhost:PORT/weatherforecast --insecure
```

üîçÔ∏è Why is the certificate not accepted by the browser or curl? What would be a way to resolve the issue?

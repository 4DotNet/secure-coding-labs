# Lab : Bad API

The [BadAPI github repo](https://github.com/alanta/BadApi) demonstrates a bunch of the common OWASP issues. It also has some tests. We're going to add some more tests to validate that improved version of the code behaves correctly.

The test should be an out-side-in test; simulate calling the API and verify that the response is correct. This demonstrated in the test called []()

Keep in mind that good tests follow a couple of guidelines:
* Use the Arrange / Assert / Act pattern : test only one thing at a time
* Don't use branching logic
* Keep the test short
* Test names should use human readable language to express what the test is doing

Assignment:
* Pick one of the scenarios
* Define what would be considered a _good_ response to various inputs
* Implement these scenarios as tests

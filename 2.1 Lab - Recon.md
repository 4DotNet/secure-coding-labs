Let's see what we can figure out about a company, just by poking around.

Visit [dnsdumpster](https://dnsdumpster.com/) and query the main domain for your company

* What hosts are there? What software are they running?
* Does any of the detected version have a vulnerability?
  *You can google for the software and version to find known issues*
* Can you connect to ports that you shouldn't be able to?
* Are there any tests sites online? 
* What cloud or hosting providers are used?
* Where is the company e-mail hosted?

Browse around the site
* What technologies does the company use? Good sources are job openings and linkedIn profiles of employees.
* Are there active parts on the site? What APIs do they call?
* What CMS does the site use? Is it WordPress?

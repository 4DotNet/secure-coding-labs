## 1. Setup your own CA
* Install [Step CLI](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli/installation/)
> You may need to restart your terminal after installing this tool to update the path variable. If you have Chocolatey installed, you can run `refreshenv` to update the path variable.

* Open a powershell terminal, preferably PowerShell 7
* Create a new folder for this lab and cd into it.
* Initialize your CA.

>  👉️ Make sure to keep the password, we'll need it again in the next steps.
```powershell
step ca init --deployment-type standalone --name MyLocalDomain --dns mycompany.local --address 127.0.0.1:443 --provisioner MyCompany 
```
This generates a root and intermediate certificate under the `.step/certs` folder in your home directory. The corresponding keys are stored in the `.step/secrets` folder.

Use [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) to explore the certificate (_Parse X.509 Certificate_). 

You should be able to see all the parts of the certificate; it's extensions, it's public key and signature.

🔍️ What type of key does the certificate use?
🔍️ What are the differences between the root and intermediate certificate?

## 2. Generate leaf certificates

```powershell
step certificate create api1.localhost api1.crt api1.key `
    --profile leaf --not-after=48h `
    --ca ~/.step/certs/intermediate_ca.crt `
    --ca-key ~/.step/secrets/intermediate_ca_key
```

Use [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) to explore the leaf certificate (_Parse X.509 Certificate_). 

🔍️ What are the differences between the CA certs and the leaf cert?
